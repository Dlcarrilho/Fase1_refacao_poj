223870,Ys I & II Chronicles+,"Feb 14, 2013",100000 - 200000,15,0,14.99,0,"Long, long ago, there was an ancient kingdom called Ys which prospered under the auspices of two heavenly Goddesses. Over time, the kingdom came to be known as Esteria, and its divine history was largely forgotten by all but the descendants of those who once preached the Goddesses’ will. The only reminder of this lost lore was a cursed spire at the foot of a giant crater, which locals came to regard as “The Devil’s Tower.” Eventually, the men and women who called Esteria their home began mining a uniquely radiant silver from the nearby mountains, and development boomed. Towns were built, and the land became rich with life. Then, all at once, monsters began to appear. Only a few at first – but soon enough, the land was swarming with them, and the Esterians had no choice but to hide in fear, remaining ever vigilant just to stay alive. Our story begins with a young man who’d heard rumors of these misfortunes, and strove to verify them with his own eyes; a brave swordsman with an adventurous spirit bolstered by his own youthful naiveté. His name was Adol Christin. With no regard for his own safety, Adol set sail toward Esteria through a heretofore impassable barrier of neverending storms. There, he was destined to become ensconced within a 700 year-old mystery that would ultimately take him to a long-lost land nestled amongst the clouds... Ys I &amp; II Chronicles+ is the most modernized and up-to-date remake of Falcom’s classic franchise-spawning action RPGs from 1987 and 1988. Come see how the story began, and witness the birth of a legend! Key Features Classic buttonless “bump” combat receives a full analog-enabled upgrade for gamepad users, and is augmented in Ys II by a robust magic system. Soundtrack selectable from among the original 80s FM-synth, an early 2000s MIDI-style remix or a modern studio performance by Falcom’s in-house rock band. Character art selectable from 90s-style portraits or more modern anime designs. Four selectable difficulty levels and optional boss rush mode grant players a true old-school challenge (if desired). Transform into a demon to speak with any and every standard enemy in the game, creating unparalleled depth that still impresses even to this day. (Ys II only) Unique Steam Achievements plus Steam Cloud support and leaderboards. Adjustable high-resolution PC graphics with a smooth, consistent framerate. Greater viewing area than in previously-available Ys I &amp; II Chronicles editions. Decorative screen frames available from the earlier Japan-only Ys I &amp; II Complete PC release, in addition to the more modernized full-screen viewport of previous Ys I &amp; II Chronicles editions.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223810/header.jpg?t=1624576213,http://www.worldofys.com/ysc/,www.xseedgames.com,support@xseedgames.com,True,False,False,0,,0,1167,144,,17,1803,,430,0,430,0,Nihon Falcom,XSEED Games,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards","Action,Adventure,RPG","JRPG,Great Soundtrack,Action,RPG,Adventure,Anime,Action RPG,Remake,Classic,Difficult,Fantasy,Top-Down,Dungeon Crawler,Singleplayer,Hack and Slash,2D,Retro,Pixel Graphics,Medieval,Old School","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223810/ss_6d0b2b05cebb6e36ca8db985eec62dc106587eee.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223810/ss_c1db09452ae57013e015fa9903791f280eb719e7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223810/ss_0cc7fe88ce6ce9555d658d1de5239078cb661d52.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223810/ss_133701fff357b65004ca0e8bed165570f468125a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223810/ss_626cbde6a02eb211cd1d1b412b6e5af1a433e2f4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223810/ss_7068d5bf441076c825b1803f35a260a6a6de2c05.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223810/ss_b25b050984b2d2ea7a6cb55c296e69a843c23909.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223810/ss_6b7d36523682e247d7d72210e76c040e3cca5dfd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223810/ss_2bbeec1af998a8e87361eb5fca1011566ba4f3df.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223810/ss_1e4fbb79ea8c6c16d0af266620c05374d164bad1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223810/ss_7880e69f9a5f7feba18cff58ed2eace7f7146fdd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223810/ss_2e9143e8f0f40678367c3441ab9b713dcaa8b6c5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223810/ss_699f05839ecb969a87b8f3b022764b8316466b23.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223810/ss_78b8e1ee17c8e3b3684843cf223235fd1ed5c016.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223810/ss_f97fa7954112fbdca47703ffe30f865f5b32daff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223810/ss_30f50e03a4d373c24ed4cd48a6a801ea291cd2ba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223810/ss_6854d4c3f47e92157c653eced90672d46a8dda7e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223810/ss_9af7867bf6d08bf30ce3eb162e74c5cb7495e983.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223810/ss_7b27ac8ccb1cf4d7f26ebbab340b20825f103487.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223810/ss_7995bbc97b40c69efa4a5c1333b3fde3c0d1891c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576213",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028372/movie_max.mp4?t=1447357437

Lystia's magic bag works like a puzzle game, where you rearrange items and power them up by getting multiples. Spirit stones broaden your options even further—for example, by allowing you to use more than one weapon or spell at the same time. Strengthening items is essential for completing dungeons! STORY To save the world from that which threatens it, Lystia—nicknamed Lys—and her partner spirit Ruka are on a grand journey to search for spirits across the lands. During their journey, they happen across a partly deserted town called Litos, where they discover that something odd is afoot. They hear that the ruins just outside of town have turned into a dungeon. Larger on the inside than it is on the outside, it also changes shape every time someone enters it. The culprit behind it all must be a spirit! And so, Lys and Ruka embark on their dungeoneering exploration in search of whatever spirit now rests in the dungeon... FEATURES An action RPG roguelike featuring all kinds of weapons and magic to take out your enemies with, as well as items to get you out of sticky situations! Power up items by lining up three with the same name in the 5x5 item window! Then, take advantage of spirit stones to use multiple weapons or spells simultaneously or grant items special effects! Offer items to the statue of the goddess in exchange for higher-rarity ones, and discover items that will change into other ones when thrown!

Meek and mild, she prefers to keep her head down, and fears drawing undue attention to herself. As a governess to the wealthy Mortimer family, Letitia devotes her humdrum days in London to the schooling of her pupil, Clara, to better mould her into the image of an ideal lady. Lurking beneath Letitia’s placid mannerisms, however, lay desires so intense they begin to unnerve her. As Clara matures, Letitia finds her feelings towards her maturing too – until, in the end, she can no longer bear it. Driven to distraction by Clara’s sensuous brown eyes and her sweet, seraphic laughter, Letitia soon begins to question her sanity. Fearful that, eventually, something within her might snap, and she will do something she regrets, Letitia is bidden to leave her former place of employment, and to seek out work elsewhere. Fortunately, Letitia soon discovers, in the pages of The Morning Post, a job offer which will grant her a means to escape her predicament. The Langley family are searching for a governess for their daughter, the unruly Genevieve – and, best of all, the family resides in the isolated Yorkshire moors, which seems as far away from London as it is possible to get. Upon reading this advertisement, Letitia soon decides to hand in her notice. She will travel to Yorkshire, become Genevieve’s governess, and then – God willing – she will be able to forget about Clara. Such was Letitia’s plan – but this plan, alas, soon goes horribly awry. Genevieve is not quite so young as Letitia first believed, and is, instead, a grown woman: already eighteen years of age. Genevieve is wilful and impetuous, but impossibly charming, and Letitia soon falls for her. As time passes, the two women get far closer than a governess and her pupil ought, and then… A story written by ebi-hime, the author of Blackberry Honey About 120k words of text (approx 4-8 hours of reading) A kinetic story with no choices/branches Detailed character and background artwork A custom OST A dramatic gothic romance story Suffering","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1779960/header.jpg?t=1650996062,,,ebihimes@gmail.com,True,False,True,0,,0,35,5,,12,0,"The story includes some crude language, and heavy implications that the two main female characters are involved in a sexual relationship, though this is not explicitly depicted in the story.

1511630,TrackDayR,"Mar 17, 2021",0 - 20000,0,0,24.99,0,"Directly From Motorcycle Physics and Dynamics Text Books The roots of TDR have been intertwined from the very beginning with the most important academic papers regarding motorcycle dynamics (eg. V. Cossalter). We worked really hard to understand the physics regarding motorcycles to be able to replicate it as accurately as possible in this project. This is not pulled out of the air: everything is validated by industrial simulation formulas, such as Magic Formula by Pacjecka, which we used as foundation to create our tire physical model. Our intention was to build a game that could give an experience as faithful to real life as it can be. Realism but with fun! We are fully committed to creating a game that could offer the maximum realism available, but that could also be enjoyed with a simple Joypad and without frustration. TDR surely isn’t an Arcade game, which means that you will make some mistakes. A late braking, a wobble, an unwanted wheelie, one too much skid will ruin your lap. Thanks to a learning curve within anyone’s’ reach, the more you will race the more you will learn your limits and become a better rider with each lap. We surely want TDR to be the peak of the simulative experience, but also something to have lots of fun with! Tire dynamics wear Tires have a dynamic wear, that are physically simulated through the patch of contact of the rubber on the asphalt. Through the track conditions and your riding style you can determine the tire performance. High quality tracks an bikes models Our all tracks are reproductions of real circuits, made with the closest fidelity and high visual impact, thanks to the High Definition Render Pipeline. Even our bikes are reproductions of real motorcycles, made taking into account all the real sizes: tires, suspensions, forks, steer, wheelbase, all data are all faithfully reported in the simulation. Not only big wheels In TDR we don’t want to only simulate standard bikes, but we love to explore other growing branches, such as the one of the small wheels. We have been supported by a leading brand in the field such as Ohvale, which makes us feel extremely lucky. The Gp-0 is nowadays used as an official motorcycle to train a lot of professional riders, and we are happy to have it in official capacity in our game toghether with important brands like Polini, who made the fastest track racing scooter and YCF, one of the most important company that produce pitbikes. The small wheels will allow us to move the challenge to kart tracks and therefore open a whole new prospective over motorcycle
